# Home Budget REST API

## This is a fairly simple project and API can be tested with Swagger so there is not a lot of explaining for testing this.
### 1. Download the code
### 2. Run the application (app.py)
### 3. In a web browser of your choice access this route http://localhost:5000/apidocs
### 4. Once that is done you will see all the possible endpoints that you can test with Swagger
